## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for the course projects of [11785 Deep Learning](http://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu) at CMU. This repository documents my journey through various deep learning assignments, starting from fundamental concepts like MLPs and progressing to advanced topics such as attention mechanisms and sequence-to-sequence models. Each assignment consists of two main components:

- **Autolab Software Engineering**: Involves building custom PyTorch libraries, implementing core algorithms, and developing optimization techniques from scratch.
  
- **Kaggle Data Science**: Focuses on real-world applications in hot AI domains such as speech recognition, face recognition, and neural machine translation.

## HW1 MLP | Phoneme Recognition

- **HW1P1**: Implementations include simple MLP activations, loss functions, and batch normalization.
  
- **HW1P2**: Kaggle challenge on [Frame-level Classification of Speech](https://www.kaggle.com/c/11-785-s20-hw1p2). Utilizes feedforward neural networks to classify phoneme state labels for audio recordings from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), demonstrating proficiency in speech recognition tasks.

## HW2 CNN | Face Recognition and Verification

- **HW2P1**: Implement NumPy-based Convolutional Neural Networks libraries.
  
- **HW2P2**: Kaggle challenges on [Face Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/11-785-s20-hw2p2-classification) and [Verification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/11-785-s20-hw2p2-verification) using CNNs. Tasks include ID prediction for face images and verification of face identity based on given samples, showcasing expertise in facial recognition technologies.

## HW3 RNN - Forward/Backword/CTC Beamsearch | Connectionist Temporal Classification
